# Online-Shopping-Intention-Analysis

In this analysis, we first imported necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and plotly to work with the dataset and visualize data. We loaded the dataset online_shoppers_intention.csv which consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. The dataset includes various features like page visits, time spent, metrics from Google Analytics, and visitor information, with the Revenue attribute used as the class label. After checking the shape and head of the dataset, we performed univariate analysis to understand the distribution of customers based on revenue and weekend purchases. We also visualized customer distributions based on visitor type, browser, region, traffic type, operating systems, and visiting months using pie charts and histograms. Further, bi-variate analysis was conducted to explore relationships between features such as product-related duration, exit rates, bounce rates, and revenue using boxen plots and strip plots. Multi-variate analysis included examining monthly variations in page values and exit rates with respect to revenue, using box and violin plots. Missing values in the dataset were imputed with zeros. Finally, clustering analysis was performed to understand user characteristics based on time spent on the website and bounce rates, using the elbow method to determine optimal clusters and visualizing them with scatter plots.
